Firefly AI Tools is a mono-repository that holds many tooling based on AI developed by Firefly, a leading AI company.

## Overview

The Firefly AI Tools repository is a collection of various AI tooling, such as libraries, frameworks, scripts, and applications, that can be used for a wide range of AI-related tasks, including data processing, machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and more.

The goal of the Firefly AI Tools repository is to provide a centralized and easy-to-use location for developers and researchers to find and use the latest AI tools developed by Firefly. The repository is designed to be modular and flexible, so that developers can pick and choose the tools that best suit their needs and integrate them into their own projects.

## Contents

The Firefly AI Tools repository is organized into several subdirectories, each containing a specific category of AI tools:

- `data-processing`: Tools for processing and cleaning data, including scripts for data ingestion, transformation, and cleaning.
- `machine-learning`: Libraries and frameworks for machine learning, including popular frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch.
- `natural-language-processing`: Tools for natural language processing tasks, including libraries for text classification, named entity recognition, and sentiment analysis.
- `computer-vision`: Libraries and frameworks for computer vision tasks, including object detection and image classification.
- `utilities`: General-purpose utilities and helper functions that can be used across various AI tasks.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Firefly AI Tools, clone the repository to your local machine and explore the various subdirectories. Each subdirectory contains its own README file with instructions on how to use the tools within that category.
